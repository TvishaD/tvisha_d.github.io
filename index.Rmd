Hello! I'm a 1st year MS-Biostatistics student at the [Columbia Mailman School of Public Health](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu). In terms of my background, I'm a [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu) graduate with a B.S in human biology. Towards the end of my undergrad journey, I decided to switch tracks from core biology to a field that would encompass more data science and analysis. I'm working towards building up the appropriate quantitative skill-set with a greater health-oriented industrial perspective.
