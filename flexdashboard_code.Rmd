```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(plotly)
```

```{r}

```


#1 Most ordered fresh vegetables

```{r Most ordered fresh veggies}

  select(product_name, aisle) %>% 
  filter(aisle == "fresh vegetables") %>% 
  group_by(product_name) %>% 
  summarise(counts = n()) %>% 
  filter(counts > 1000) %>% 
  mutate(product_name = fct_reorder(product_name, counts)) %>% 
  plot_ly(x = ~product_name, y = ~counts, type = "bar")
  
```

#2 Time-wise trend in overall produce/snacks/personal-care orders

```{r Time-wise trend in overall produce/snacks/personal-care orders}
